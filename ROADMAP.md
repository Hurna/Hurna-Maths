# Roadmap

A rough roadmap for `hurna-maths`

What concepts are needed to answer questions asked:

- Factoring: 22.84% of questions
- Solve Equation: 17.99% of questions
- Systems of equations: 6.34% of questions
- Negative exponents: 1.96% of questions

## Version 1.x

- Factoring quadratics to solve equations ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/hurna/hurna-maths/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aopen%20equation))
- Factoring (quadratics and other simple factoring) to simplify polynomial
  fractions
- Improving exponents ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/hurna/hurna-maths/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+exponents+label%3Aexponents))
- Improving roots ([open issues that are
  related](https://github.com/hurna/hurna-maths/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Aissue%20is%3Aopen%20label%3Aroots%20))
- Systems of equations ([#48](https://github.com/hurna/hurna-maths/issues/48))

## Version 2.x
